# Revo example: Task list app
**Revo.Examples.Todos** is a simple application intended as an introduction to Revo framework. It showcases some of its most basic features including DDD-style event sourced aggregates and entities, commands and queries, projections and read models.

Using this simple application, one should be able to track his tasks to do. User can create task lists, to which tasks (to-dos) can be added (and later modified, deleted or marked as 'done').
